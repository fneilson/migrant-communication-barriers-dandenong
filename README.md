# The communication barriers that hamper our emergency response

This is an original analysis that I designed and executed for the Foundations of Data Science unit in my Master of Data Science degree studies in October 2020, using the R statistical analysis package and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) microdata from the last census in 2016. 

The title is 'The communication barriers that hamper our emergency response' and the analysis sought to explore the English language and literacy profiles of a multiculturally diverse community in south eastern Melbourne, Australia and show which groups are the most disadvantaged and advantaged in terms of their ability to receive emergency communications. 

I am not permitted to upload ABS microdata to this repository so I have uploaded the R Markdown files with output, which helps illustrate the dataset, and I have included summaries where possible.

I was motivated to explore the relationship between native language, socio-economic status and English proficiency as this intersects with my volunteer work with asylum seekers in my community, and with my background in communications, literary and language studies. While I am not a social scientist, I hope this study shows some of the possible ways of understanding the diversity of migrant communities. My assessor found that my use of language spoken at home as a proxy for ethnic group, rather than country of birth, was original and important part of the analysis.
